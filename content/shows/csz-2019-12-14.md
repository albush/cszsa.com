It's our ComedySportz Main Event! Come out and see the Bexars in Blue battle it out with the Punslingers in Red, in a battle for laughs, glory, and fabulous points. The show starts at 7:30, so get here a bit early to grab a snack and find your seat.

**Food And Drink Policy:** We are a BYOB facility for alcoholic beverages. You're welcome to bring your own beverage and drink responsibly at our venue. No outside food or soft drinks allowed; please see our snack bar for some tasty snacks.
