We're baaaaaaaaaaaaack!!! We've missed all you Loyal Fans so much! **All month long, all tickets are only $10!**

It's our ComedySportz Main Event! Come out and see the Bexars in Blue battle it out with the Punslingers in Red, in a battle for laughs, glory, and fabulous points. The show starts at 7:30, so get here a bit early to grab a snack and find your seat.

**Health and Safety Information**

We're re-opening with a few safety procedures in place. All of our performers and staff are vaccinated against Covid-19. We've instituted an enhanced cleaning program. Seating is limited and re-designed to provide additional space. Masks are not required, but are encouraged.

**Food and Drink Policy**

We no longer allow outside food and drinks, but we've got a fully stocked snack bar for you.
