On the eve of Father's Day, Jason Boyson captained the Punslingers in Red, vs the all-Dad, all-bald [Hairless Whispers](https://open.spotify.com/track/4jDmJ51x1o9NZB5Nxxc7gY). It was a back and forth match, but in the end, team Hairless Whisper won the match.  Many thanks to all of the Dads in the audience who cheered us all on, and gave us great suggestions. Shoutout to Dave Van Kirk for getting John Fitzhugh to guess the boy band "Menudo" in Six Things. That took some talent.
