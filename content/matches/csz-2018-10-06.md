After a close start, the Bexars in Blue surged ahead with a strong showing in 6 Things, and an even stronger showing in the concessions Halftime Challenge. The Punslingers in Red made the game close again, with a victory on Accent Roller Coaster. The Bexars were able to hold off the Punslingers in heated game of Letter's From Camp, and ended up taking home the victory.

Special thanks to our audience guest this evening, Monica; hope to see you at a match again soon.
