After a close start, the Bexars in Blue surged ahead with a strong showing in 6 Things, and an even stronger showing in the concessions Halftime Challenge. The Punslingers in Red made the game close again, with a victory on Accent Roller Coaster. The Bexars were able to hold off the Punslingers in heated game of Letter's From Camp, and ended up taking home the victory.
