## What is ComedySportz?

ComedySportz is competitive improvisational comedy.

Two teams, The Punslingers in Red and The Bexars in Blue battle for the laughs of you, the Loyal Fans. The Players create comedic scenes, songs and games based on the suggestions of the audience. A Referee times the games, calls the fouls and keeps things moving while an Announcer gives scoring updates and color commentary.

ComedySportz is interactive and appropriate for **EVERYONE**. And because it is interactive, the audience gets in on the fun by awarding points, shouting out suggestions and choosing the **WINNER**!

## A ComedySportz Match is for Everyone

Worried about content? Don’t be! Our Road Shows are appropriate for school show audiences of any age or background. ComedySportz Road Shows have performed at:

- Elementary Schools
- Middle School
- High Schools
- Colleges
- Morning Assemblies
- Faith Groups (including Bar and Bat Mitzvahs)
- Summer Camps

Just about any event you can think of!

## Educational and Entertaining

Want to add some educational programming to your entertainment? Our Players have been performing and improvising for decades and they love to share what they know. If requested, the Players will meet with the kids after the match to answer any questions they may have about improvisation as an art form and life skill, the theater and ComedySportz.

Think your Middle School or High School students might want to get more involved? Add an Improv Workshop to the assembly! We offer a variety of workshops for groups large and small. The students will learn the basics of improv while actually getting up and playing some of our most popular games.  Workshops can also be booked by themselves.
