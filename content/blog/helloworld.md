Oh really? Then why don't you come down and make me then. Carrie, Moss! First scene in Carrie! Oh. Okay Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN! Oh my God. I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk. I'm a 32 year old IT-man who works in a basement. Yes, I do the whole Lonely Hearts thing! So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3!
