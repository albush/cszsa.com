title: Congrats New Minor Leaguers
---

Please join us in welcoming our newest ComedySportz Minor Leaguers! We hosted tryouts over the weekend and had 27 participants over two days. Narrowing the amazing talent down to only 14 was definitely one of the most difficult decisions we've had to make. We're excited to start working with our new Minor League team, and start to bring you shows starting soon.
