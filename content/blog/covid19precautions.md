### We are still open for business!

Come laugh and have fun if you are feeling well. At ComedySportz San Antonio, our Loyal Fans are our first priority, please continue to support the local arts community, and know that we will keep our matches/schedule, and CDC support up to date here and on social media.

With that being said, here are measures we have implemented:

## Updated Procedures

* We are stepping up our cleaning procedures, disinfectants,  and sanitation before and after matches, classes, and any time the facility will be used.
* We are wiping down all surfaces with disinfectant before and after every use, providing hand sanitizing stations, and providing plenty of antibacterial soap, and a visual aid posted in restrooms both in English and Spanish on how to properly wash hands per the CDC Guidelines.
* We will be checking in with staff and players to make sure that if they feel unwell,  they are not coming in for their shifts. And Please do not come to a match as a fan if you do not feel well.
* We will be temporarily suspending high fives. However jazz hands and friendly waves are still in effect.
* Our Brown Bags are now single use and will go home with Loyal Fans or be properly disposed of after the match.
* Currently the CDC recommends not holding events for crowds of 200+ people. In efforts to make sure everyone is comfortable, We are temporarily limiting ticket sales by â…“ capacity. Meaning a new maximum of 36 seats per event. This will allow for plenty of room and comfort at matches and events hosted by ComedySportz San Antonio.
* We will also be closely monitoring CDC guidelines and making updated adjustments per their recommendations.
