## Our Class Curriculum

### Improv 101 - Classes start July 11th


We focus on the basics of improvisation: team-building, trust, speed, status, active listening, and agreement. You will learn to be fearless and have fun on stage! This workshop emphasizes basic verbal and physical communication skills by exploring spontaneity, active listening, risk-taking, story-telling, character development, and other fun stuff in a safe, non-judgmental environment. Laughter and positive vibes guaranteed. No prerequisite except willingness for silliness. You learn the fundamentals for creating effective improv scene work. Giggles, chuckles, and guffaws included in course fee. It will be one of the funniest and most fun, life strengthening things you will ever do for yourself.
Improv 101 consists of six 2 hour sessions, followed by a showcase jam session on the 7th week.

**No prerequisites or previous experience required.**

**Important Health and Safety Information**

A mask fully covering the nose and chin will be required for every class participant, and waivers must be signed the first day of class. $100 non refundable deposit required. Educator is vaccinated. Class maximum capacity is 10 students. 2 hours per class for 7 weeks.

**Registration fee:** $225 ($100 deposit required to hold spot.)


### Improv 201 - No Classes Available

We build on the basic skills of Improv 101 to further creativity, fun, and technical skills. This workshop focuses on space-object work, creating characters, narrative storytelling, gibberish, initiating (starting scenes), heightening (coming into a scene), and thinking faster. Learn to apply your play in ways to build spontaneous stories and fantastic scenes. For the non-actor, this class provides you with great skills for public speaking, teaching, and impressive leadership. Once you know the art of improv, you'll never worry about forgetting the lines to a speech because you will have the tools to make it work.
Each workshop is six 2.5 hour sessions.

**Prerequisite**: Completed 101 or equivalent.

**Registration fee:** $200 (Or reserve your spot for $100 and pay the balance at your first class.)

### Improv 301 - No Classes Available

Improv 301 expands the scope of the scene. By connecting further to the scene and group as a whole you will be able to create larger grounded scenes overall.
