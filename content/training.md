CSz improv and applied improv classes are a fun, supportive way to learn improvisational thinking and gain self-confidence. Don’t be fooled into thinking improv is just for performers - many of our students use improv to develop business soft-skills, and communicate better - and they meet other cool people! There's almost always a CSz improv class running, so check out our class calendar and sign up today!
