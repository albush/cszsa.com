"Bio": "I took my first improv class at Comedy Sportz San Antonio just last year.  After that first class, I decided that I wasn't done with improv yet and that I would continue. A few classes later, I tried out for the Comedy Sportz Minor League and made the team. This summer I graduated from Minor League and played in my first Major League match. I never thought that I would improv as a hobby, but here I am. When I'm not on the Comedy Sportz field, I do the occasional improv at nearby Bexar Stage."
