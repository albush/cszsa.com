Are you missing the fun of improv  and/or improv class?
Come join the CSz Virtual Jams!! These jams are planned and directed just like a class would be. We will meet twice a week from 7-8:30pm for the month of April starting on the 7th. If we have a high enrollment we can build an additional time slot. Be ready to play improv games and have fun making things up, virtually!! If you have ever taken an improv class or been on an improv team you meet the qualifications!!
