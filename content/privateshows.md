You want your event to be special. You want comedy that's fresh, appeals to everyone, and offends no one. You want entertainment that's customized to you? You want ComedySportzÂ®.

### Totally Customized For Your Event. Totally Funny.

It's the improv comedy match that takes your audience's suggestions and spins them into hilarious scenes and games. It's all about YOUR group and your event, and it's always in good taste. Everybody laughs, every time!

Since 1984 Nationwide. Since 1994 in San Antonio. Why risk anyone else?
For over 20 years, we've been the preferred comedy match for events, meetings, conventions, conferences and more. Why risk hiring a stand-up whose material might not click with your group? ComedySportz is customized to your event so it works every single time.

### Always Positive for Any Event

We've entertained at an amazing array of companies, large and small. ComedySportz is completely flexible and scalable, from a 15-minute United Way Kickoff to a fully produced World Tour. We perform in spaces from conference rooms to outdoor festivals, and everything in between. Our match always tailors itself to your group, and it's always positive, hilarious and clean.

### Easy to Book. Easier to Work With.

It's about meeting your needs for fast, fun, clean entertainment.
We offer ComedySportz Match, ComedySportz Half-Court and ComedySportz Exhibition formats, something for almost every budget. Need something out of the ordinary? Just ask! Need a location? We've got one, and we know about some great spaces around the metro area, too.

## CSz Business Training. Because work is more than numbers.

> Customer Service. Leadership. Communications Skills. Soft Skills. Agility. Employee Engagement.


As CSz performers, we use our improvisation skills onstage to get people laughing. Conveniently, offstage, we use them to run a successful business. We specialize in teaching people HOW to use improvisation techniques in their work lives. We teach the essential, yet often overlooked or discarded, communication and listening skills that will consistently improve the quality of your work, home and social relationships. We call this **Applied Improvisation**.

### Customer Service

> What if your employees were empowered to make customer service an opportunity instead of a cost?

The top of your game is not your rulebook, nor your script, nor what you did with the last customer. It's improvisation - a highly refined system of observing, connecting and responding.
We apply improv to these areas:

- Listening with focus
- Accepting circumstances
- Empathy with Customers
- Supporting the Team - making others look good
- Letting Go of preconceived roles and roadblocks
- Sharing mistakes - and shaking them off
- Saying YES, AND...
- Finding where we're needed without direction
- Awareness of the Big Picture

And while we help your people become more effective, we're bonding them together, engaging them and helping you retain them.

Workshops range from two hours to multiple days to a series over several weeks.  Let us know what you need.  We'd love to help you get your service to the next level.
