The ComedySportz High School League® is the largest, most successful teen improv theatre program in the United States.

We play improvisation as a team sport, with two teams “competing” for audience laughs. The stage is covered in turf, there’s a referee and the players are in uniform. It’s not comedy about sports; it’s comedy played as a sport. Because everyone knows what a sport is, there is immediated buy-in from the audience. People who have never been to the theatre before walk through the door because they’re not intimidated. Because it’s improvisational, it’s always different, and you will have fans that come to every performance.
