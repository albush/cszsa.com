You want your event to be special. You want comedy that's fresh, appeals to everyone, and offends no one. You want entertainment that's customized to you? You want ComedySportzÂ®.

### Totally Customized For Your Event. Totally Funny.

It's the improv comedy match that takes your audience's suggestions and spins them into hilarious scenes and games. It's all about YOUR group and your event, and it's always in good taste. Everybody laughs, every time!

Since 1984 Nationwide. Since 1994 in San Antonio. Why risk anyone else?
For over 20 years, we've been the preferred comedy match for events, meetings, conventions, conferences and more. Why risk hiring a stand-up whose material might not click with your group? ComedySportz is customized to your event so it works every single time.

### Always Positive for Any Event

We've entertained at an amazing array of companies, large and small. ComedySportz is completely flexible and scalable, from a 15-minute United Way Kickoff to a fully produced World Tour. We perform in spaces from conference rooms to outdoor festivals, and everything in between. Our match always tailors itself to your group, and it's always positive, hilarious and clean.

### Easy to Book. Easier to Work With.

It's about meeting your needs for fast, fun, clean entertainment.
We offer ComedySportz Match, ComedySportz Half-Court and ComedySportz Exhibition formats, something for almost every budget. Need something out of the ordinary? Just ask! Need a location? We've got one, and we know about some great spaces around the metro area, too.
