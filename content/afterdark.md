title: After Dark Presents

Join us every Saturday night for our **After Dark Presents** series. These shows will differ from ComedySportz in both content and style â€“ no brown bag, so you may want to leave the kids at home, and we'll also see different styles: long form, musical improv, improvised game night, and many other styles.
