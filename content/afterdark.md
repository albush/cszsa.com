After Dark is Studio 185's Saturday, late night, BYOB, PG-17, anything goes, improv show.

#### This week's teams:

**Throuple** - What two people can do, three can do better.

**[Therapy 3.0](https://www.facebook.com/therapy3point0/)** - They put the dysfunction in dysfunctional. Relationships are best when they are awkward.

**Fight Club** - Energy. Chaos. Madness. Weirdness. Improv.

**Time Out** - What if Zack Morris was not trash? Or if he shared his magical, fourth wall breaking "Time Out" power with others? Find out.
