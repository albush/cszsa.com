We're taking the rest of the month off from After Dark Performances. Check back here for updates as they come in. ComedySportz Main Event shows are still happening, so [get your tickets](/shows/) for one of the 7:30 shows!

<!-- Join us every Saturday night for our **After Dark Presents** series. These shows will differ from ComedySportz in both content and style â€“ no brown bag, so you may want to leave the kids at home, and we'll also see different styles: long form, musical improv, improvised game night, and many other styles. -->
