## You may be our next Minor League All-Star

We're holding tryouts for our Minor League Team! Come audition to be a part of our improvisational comedy group!

Does everyone say you're funny, and should perform in front of crowds? Do you always have that perfect comeback? Have you taken some improv classes and want a chance to perform regularly? Well come out and audition for the ComedySportz Minor League!

If you'd like to come spend some time learning improv with weekly workshops, getting monthly opportunities to play ComedySportz on the CSz playing field, and hanging out with some of the coolest people on the planet, then don't miss this!
