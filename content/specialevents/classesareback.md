In person classes are back, with limited capacity, masks, and other safety precautions.

Our next Improv 101 Class starts on July 11th. The class runs for seven weeks, and each class is two hours. There will be a showcase jam session at the end of the class.

A mask fully covering the nose and chin will be required for every class participant, and waivers must be signed the first day of class Educator is vaccinated. Class maximum capacity is 10 students.
