## Our City-Wide Improv Showcase and Tournament is Back!

Join us April 4-6 as we crown the next Improv Royale Champions. Improv Royale is a twice annual improv competition featuring completely random teams. The week before the shows, local improvisors – many of whom have never perfomred together – are randomly assigned to teams.

### Get Your Tickets Now

Those teams will have 1 week to come up with an improv format and practice with their team. The teams will perform for audiences at ComedySportz San Antonio on either Thursday the 4th of April, or Friday the 5th of April. The audience will vote for the teams that advance, and those teams will play again on Saturday April 6th for the final championship.

Don't miss your chance to see this once-in-a-lifetime event.
