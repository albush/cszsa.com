# Editing Content for cszsa.come

Hi! Welcome to the contnet management system (CMS) for ComedySportz San Antonio. Here's a quick intro on how to edit content or add new content on the site.

## How it all works

We use a tool called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to create a static website. The majority of the content on cszsa.com is static - it rarely changes. Because of this, we can host the site very efficiently (both in terms of hosting and money) via static html pages that are hosted on Amazon Web Services, and served through their Content Delivery Network. Hugo takes the code and the raw content, and converts it to html, which can then be read by a browser on your computer or phone. We use a service called [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) to automate testing and publishing.

Finally, we use [Forestry](https://forestry.io) to make editing and creating new content easier, and that's probably where you're reading this right now.

## How do I change stuff?

The types of items you will likely want to change are blog posts, class announcements, and show schedules.
