  <h1>About</h1>
  

<h2 id="what-is-comedysportz">What is ComedySportz?</h2>

<p>It’s not comedy about sports; it’s comedy PLAYED as a sport! Two teams of our professional improvisers compete for laughs and points in this hilarious comedy competition. It’s complete with a referee, uniforms, artificial turf, pennants, an organist and even the National Anthem!</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ComedySportzSanAntonio/">Facebook</a> page to find out who&rsquo;s playing this weekend, and click the link to buy some tickets.</p>

<p><a href="https://cszsanantonio.vbotickets.com/event/ComedySportz_Main_Event/10273" class="button special">Buy Tickets</a></p>

<p>There are fouls in ComedySportz to keep the show from being boring or in poor taste; there’s even one to make a player apologize for telling a lame joke! When was the last time you saw that? The show is always completely interactive, and suitable for all audiences.  If you think “clean” is boring, you owe it to yourself to check us out. It’s anything but boring.</p>

<p>ComedySportz® even works for tough-to-please business groups.
Because everything is improvised, no two matches are alike. Fans never see the same thing twice, and they return again and again to cheer on their favorite players. The audience helps pick what games the teams will play, yells suggestions and ultimately decides which team is the evening’s winner.</p>

  <h1>Corporate Training and Team Building</h1>
  

<h2 id="csz-business-training-because-work-is-more-than-numbers">CSz Business Training. Because work is more than numbers.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Customer Service. Leadership. Communications Skills. Soft Skills. Agility. Employee Engagement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As CSz performers, we use our improvisation skills onstage to get people laughing. Conveniently, offstage, we use them to run a successful business. We specialize in teaching people HOW to use improvisation techniques in their work lives. We teach the essential, yet often overlooked or discarded, communication and listening skills that will consistently improve the quality of your work, home and social relationships. We call this <strong>Applied Improvisation</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="customer-service">Customer Service</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>What if your employees were empowered to make customer service an opportunity instead of a cost?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The top of your game is not your rulebook, nor your script, nor what you did with the last customer. It&rsquo;s improvisation - a highly refined system of observing, connecting and responding.<br />
We apply improv to these areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Listening with focus</li>
<li>Accepting circumstances</li>
<li>Empathy with Customers</li>
<li>Supporting the Team - making others look good</li>
<li>Letting Go of preconceived roles and roadblocks</li>
<li>Sharing mistakes - and shaking them off</li>
<li>Saying YES, AND&hellip;</li>
<li>Finding where we&rsquo;re needed without direction</li>
<li>Awareness of the Big Picture</li>
</ul>

<p>And while we help your people become more effective, we&rsquo;re bonding them together, engaging them and helping you retain them.</p>

<p>Workshops range from two hours to multiple days to a series over several weeks.  Let us know what you need.  We&rsquo;d love to help you get your service to the next level.</p>
