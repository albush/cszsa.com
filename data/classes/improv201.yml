"Description": "We build on the basic skills of Improv 101 to further creativity, fun, and technical skills. This workshop focuses on space-object work, creating characters, narrative storytelling, gibberish, initiating (starting scenes), heightening (coming into a scene), and thinking faster. Learn to apply your play in ways to build spontaneous stories and fantastic scenes. For the non-actor, this class provides you with great skills for public speaking, teaching, and impressive leadership. Once you know the art of improv, you'll never worry about forgetting the lines to a speech because you will have the tools to make it work.
