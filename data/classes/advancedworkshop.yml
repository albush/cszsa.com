"Description": "Look, it's been a while for all of us. We've tried the video improv thing, the game nights, but if you ask any of us to get on a stage, we'll all feel a little rusty. So join us for a refresher on in person improv skills with an emphasis on doing scenes with feedback from the teacher. This 4 hour workshop has a maximum capacity of 10, so hurry and book your spot now."
