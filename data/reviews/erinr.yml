"Review": "ComedySportz (Club 185) is my favorite destination for a girls night out, date night, or a family night. Consistently funny, always clean, great value, and so much fun! My face gets sore from smiling so much. Shows are every Friday and Saturday at 7:30 pm. You can bring in food and drink or buy chips/soda/candy at the concession stand. We have been going for years! We like it so much that my husband took several of their improv classes and is now one of the players."
