"Review": "This is my favorite thing to do on a Friday or Saturday night! This is very similar to “Whose Line Is It Anyway, ” but it’s live right here in SA! The talent is top notch and it’s always different each time we go. They are never vulgar or lewd, but they are still hilarious. The price is right and I love that they are a BYOB establishment."
