"Bio": "Amantha, admittedly, has no background in improv or comedy. She took the 101 class on a whim in 2019 and immediately drank the improv kool-aid. She tried out for the Minor League before even finishing the class and, well, here she is! When she's not trying to be funny on stage, you can most likely find Amantha on the internet, working as a digital marketing strategist or just spending too much time on YouTube."
