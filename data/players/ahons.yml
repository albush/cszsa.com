Name: ahons
"FirstName": "Amantha"
"LastName": "Hons"
"Bio": "Amantha, admittedly, has no background in improv or comedy. She took the 101 class on a whim in 2019 and immediately drank the improv kool-aid. She tried out for the Minor League before even finishing the class and, well, here she is! She loves character and genre games, Marvel movies, and reminding her coworkers that most meetings should definitely just be emails."
