"Bio": "Alyssa started acting professionally in 2009, and joined ComedySportz in 2012. She has since attended 3 CsZ World Championships, and stolen many funny jokes from great new friends over the years (don’t worry, she “asked” for permission). Alyssa owns a dance and acting studio in San Antonio, and spends all of her free time rock climbing. She is deathly afraid of snakes, and sometimes hibernates in the summer to avoid seeing one in nature. "
