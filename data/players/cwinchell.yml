"Bio": "Channing started taking long-form improv classes at Bexar Stage in January 2019 and was immediately addicted. She is currently active with probably too many long-form teams, including Tiny Mamá, Kisses & Fists, Level Up, and Life Crisis Puppet Theater. Channing joined the ComedySportz Minor Leagues in May 2019 and has been embracing dad jokes ever since. She loves animals (ESPECIALLY dogs!), music with great bass, Taco Bell, memes, tofu, Eurovision, spinning people around while hugging them, looking concerned, and – of course – improv! She hates bananas."
