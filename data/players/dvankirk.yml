"LastName": "Van Kirk"
"Bio": "Dave came to ComedySportz late in life. Like, REAL late in life… Like, almost TOO late. Not that there are any actual CSz age limits. Not at all. But one would agree that there is a very physical aspect to this sport(z) and Dave’s doctors have consistently advised him that his body is not unlike a Faberge Egg. Exquisite and invaluable? Absolutely… But also as delicate as a soap bubble. Dave plays with the sobering knowledge that every match could be his —— record scratch —— Hold the phone!  Since this bio’s original publication, Dave has unlocked the secrets to the mind-body connection and now ATTACKS the stage every night with the full knowledge that, with his trusty book by his side, his body is near INDESTRUCTIBLE!  All hail “THE BOOK” and catch Dave performing elsewhere in town as part of MY 4 DADS, GRUMPY OLD MEN, ENTRAILS: THE PODCAST, or any other Scribner-based troupes."
