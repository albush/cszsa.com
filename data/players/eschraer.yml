"LastName": "Schraer"
"Bio": "I auditioned after taking a couple classes. I had to fail a lot. I periodically do shows at Bexar Stage. The most pain I\'ve ever been in was when I had dental implants drilled into my jaw and the anesthetic wore off before the procedure was completed. Bombing on stage is a close second. Mark Twain is my hero."
