"Bio": "Cristal started her improv career by taking an 101 class at Comedy Sportz in the May of 2018. At the time only a selected few knew about her secret life of improv. Slowly improv became more than just a class. Now her friends are like okay we love you, but we can’t come to ALL your shows. Basically, Cristal will invite anyone to an improv show, like people at her dentist’s office, employees of establishments that she frequents, and even YOU! You can catch her at Comedy Sportz or in one of her long-form teams."
