Name: rgardner
"FirstName": "Rosa"
"LastName": "Gardner"
"Bio": "A few years ago, I had just moved to San Antonio and decided to go to a ladies’ improv jam so I could get out and meet new friends. During casual chatter afterward, two awesome women, Lisa and Morgan, mentioned that they were players at CSz and that minor league tryouts were coming up... the rest is history! I’ve loved becoming part of the CSz family. When I’m not on the field, you will likely find me either on stage performing or at home baking."
