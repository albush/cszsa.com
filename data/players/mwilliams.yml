"Bio": "Ugh. I got into ComedySportz via a Google search result for \"Stand Up classes in San Antonio.\"  There were none, but a CSzSA Improv 101 class was the top result.  I signed up for that one - with my spam email account.  I showed up to the first class and CSzSA and the door was locked, lights were out.  They had tried to reach me at my spam email to tell me the class didn't have enough participation to make. The universe tried to stop me, but I prevailed and signed up for the next 101 class.  I also perform with Missed Opportunity (an all female Bexar Stage house team) and Whine Time. We drink.  I have performed at CSz Twin Cities, CSz Houston, and CSz Championsips (LA).  I have two cats and no kids."
