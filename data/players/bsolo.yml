Name: bsolo
"FirstName": "Bailey"
"LastName": "Solo"
"Bio": "Bailey first started in ComedySportz in her freshman year of high school, and started in San Antonio in October of 2016 on the Minor Leagues! She loves groaner fouls, barf noises, and doing bar things on stage. Eventually she hopes to do a match without her hair in a ponytail, but the relative heat of that event would most likely set the field ablaze. Pisces."
