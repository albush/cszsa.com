My face gets sore from smiling so much. Shows are every Friday and Saturday at 7:30 pm. You can bring in food and drink or buy chips/soda/candy at the concession stand. We have been going for years! We like it so much that my husband took several of their improv classes and is now one of the players."

The talent is top notch and it’s always different each time we go. They are never vulgar or lewd, but they are still hilarious. The price is right and I love that they are a BYOB establishment."
