text = "I hadn't been to ComedySportz in years (since i was a little kid) and once I found out there was one in San Antonio I felt like I had to go. I was a little worried it wouldn't be as funny as I remembered it being when I was younger, but I was beyond pleasantly surprised. Going to this show was the most I've laughed in a really long time as an adult, and the improv players were hilarious and talented, and the other staff were friendly and helpful. Despite the theme being family friendly (and kids are allowed), the entertainment is definitely good for all ages, and the place is even BYOB (which I need to remember for next time). I will definitely going back, soon - there's no reason not to! It a ton of fun, and the ticket prices are low enough for it to be reasonable to go even once a week if you really wanted to - it's a different show every time and you'll probably laugh more than if you went to the movies. Thanks for a fantastic time, CSz!"

My face gets sore from smiling so much. Shows are every Friday and Saturday at 7:30 pm. You can bring in food and drink or buy chips/soda/candy at the concession stand. We have been going for years! We like it so much that my husband took several of their improv classes and is now one of the players."
